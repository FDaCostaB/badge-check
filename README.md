# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle. Create a function taking a PNG as input and verifying that:\
*Size = 512x512*\
*The only non transparent pixels are within a circle*\
*That the colors of the badge give a "happy" feeling*\
Additionally, you can create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object. (Not implemented)

## How to run ?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
